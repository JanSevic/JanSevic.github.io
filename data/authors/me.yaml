role: PhD Student & Researcher

bio: |
  I am a PhD student and a researcher at the Department of Industrial Informatics at the 
  Czech Technical University in Prague. My research, which previously focused on Quantum Structures, 
  is now centered on improving the efficiency of industrial processes. My work earned me some 
  recognition, including a third-place finish at the SVOČ competition and being named the Tech Talent 
  of the Czech Republic for 2025. Currently, I teach the Algorithms and Parallel Algorithms courses.
